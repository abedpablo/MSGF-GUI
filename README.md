# MSGF-GUI
GUI to select or add MSGF protein modifications built in Python 2.7

MSGF+ (aka MSGF-Plus) performs peptide identification by scoring MS/MS spectra against peptides derived from a protein sequence database. Within the larger pipeline, the laboratory group selects desired protein modification from a text file (please see msgf_mods.txt file) with several listed protein modifications to narrow the search. Before the addition of this GUI, the group would manually edit the text file by editing in or our a ‘#’ from the desired protein modifications. I created a GUI for users to (1) select which modifications to use for the MS-GF+ search engine that was in a much easier form to read and (2) allowed users to input new modifications without repeating previously entered selections and placed it with the desired MS-GF+ format. 

Please see www.unimod.org for search engine.
